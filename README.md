# My-Portfolio

Welcome to my python portfolio, here you find all of the github links to my python projects and code examples. This very site is built using python and Flask with SQLAlchemy running a small back-end

How to run locally:

Download the project files from my github or clone the repository.
Create a virtual environment within the project file.
Install packages from the requirements.txt file.
Run app.py from the terminal.
Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000 in your browser and navigate the website. I hope you enjoy my Portfolio. I had so much fun creating this and seeing the final result brought me so much joy!
What I've learned:

This was a fun experience using my problem solving skills and creating games and websites. I truly enjoyed the process no matter how frustrating at times the end results and the final project brought me so much enjoyment that it made it all worth it, this is definately the first of many.
I want to continue learning and improving the skills i've learned from this Techdegree and I've definatley improved.
I learned how I can use python for web development and creating simple and even complex games.
I learned how to use the PEP8 Guidlines which has really improved my code alot.
